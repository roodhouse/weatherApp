# Week 6 / Module 6 Challenge

## Description 

### [Website](https://roodhouse.github.io/weekSix/)

Created a weather app. I was able to get the weather funcationality to dynamically update. I was not able to begin localstorage or begin to polish the look of the app. Those are things I will need to return to do later in the course.
